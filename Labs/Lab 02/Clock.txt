1. What happens if you enter a string instead of the number?
	The program does not execute properly, and the compiler reads "Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException".

2. What happens if you enter an extreme large number, for example, 3,000,000,000? 
	The program will not execute properly, and the compiler reads "Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException: For input string: "3000000000"".

3. What happens if you enter a negative number?
	In this case, the program still executes properly, and the output will be the same, but total seconds will be negative and the negative number will appear negative in the hours:minutes:seconds format, depending on which variable the negative number was assigned to.

4. Try to explain the above three cases base on your observation.
	In the first case, the input must be an integer value, so inputting a string will prevent the program from running properly since a string can't be assigned to the int variable "hours".
	In the second case, the input must be within the range of values for an int variable (-2147483648 to 2147483647), so 3000000000 can't be assigned to hours since it is too large of a number for an int variable.
	In the third case, the program works since a negative number is still acceptable for an int variable, even though it does not make sense to have a negative hour/minute/second value when telling the time in 24 hour format.
