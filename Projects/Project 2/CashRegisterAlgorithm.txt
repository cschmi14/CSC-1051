Follow the Algorithm procedure in class will help you design your own program.

1. List all the inputs and outputs.
	Inputs: originalCents;
	Outputs: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies;

2. Figure out the computational relationships between the inputs and outputs.
	originalCents = (QUARTER_VALUE * quarters) + (DIME_VALUE * dimes) + (NICKEL_VALUE * nickels) + (pennies * PENNY_VALUE);

3. Write down the variables and the types based on your inputs, outputs and computational procedure.
         int originalCents; // only used to print at the end to show the original amount in cents
         int cents; // variable that will decrease in the equations later on to calculate the number of each coin
	 int quarters;
	 int dimes;
	 int nickels;
	 int pennies;
	 final int QUARTER_VALUE = 25;
	 final int DIME_VALUE = 10;
	 final int NICKEL_VALUE = 5;
	 final int PENNY_VALUE = 1;

4. Translate the computational relationships to expressions and statements.
	cents = originalCents
	quarters = cents / QUARTER_VALUE;
	cents = cents - (quarters * QUARTER_VALUE);
	dimes = cents / DIME_VALUE;
	cents = cents - (dimes * DIME_VALUE);
	nickels = cents / NICKEL_VALUE;
	cents = cents - (nickels * NICKEL_VALUE);
	pennies = cents / PENNY_VALUE;


5. Write down the ways to collect inputs and deliver the outputs.
	Collecting Inputs:
	System.out.println("Enter the total amount of cents here: ");
	originalCents = scan.nextInt();
        cents = originalCents

	Delivering Outpouts:
	 System.out.println(originalCents + " cents = ");
	 System.out.println("           " + quarters + " Quarters");
	 System.out.println("           " + dimes + " Dimes");
	 System.out.println("           " + nickels + " Nickels");
	 System.out.println("           " + pennies + " Pennies");
